# Typescript Conventions

- Use `biome` to format code
- Use `types` over `interface` (unless interface is required such for declaration
  merging for example)
- Use `function myFunction() { ... }` over `const myFunction = () => { ... }` when
  a function is in top level on the file
- Use arrow function when a function lives inside an other function
- Don't use `class` unless you have no choice
- Suffix react props `types` with `export type NameOfTheComponentProps = { ... }`
- Don't use `myArray[index]` use `myArray.at(index)` when possible
- It's ok to export many things inside a file as long as it keeps the coherence
- Always use alias `@/some-path` to import local files (easy refactoring)
